A Single Page JavaScript Application to display GIF results from [Giphy's developer API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide).

The application includes the following features:

- A control to show the latest Cat or Dog results (no search field needed).
- Results view with paging of 25 GIFs per page.
- A detail view which shows the selected GIF when clicked.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
